The fundamentals of deep learning by implementing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) from scratch in Python, using the Numpy library for handling n-dimensional arrays. 
The written code will be used to train and evaluate MLPs for regression and classification applications.

It uses MPG dataset and Mnist dataset to test if the multilayer perceptrons work.
